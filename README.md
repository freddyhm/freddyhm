<h2>Why not use a template?</h2>

After using this <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/punch-responsive-portfolio-wordpress-theme/3036959" alt="Punch Wordpress Theme">punch wordpress theme</a> for a couple of years, I felt the burning desire to build my own personal responsive site from scratch. I feel I'm growing too complacent with whatever approach gets the job done. I think that's kinda shitty. We should all try to make the web a better place! (Yaaayy). So this is my attempt at following best practices, clean design, and optimized content, all while using new-ish tools.

<i>Goal: Use modern techniques and best practices to build a portfolio site aka catching up</i>

<h2>But you're copying this guy's <a href="https://github.com/DevTips/Artists-Theme" alt="Git Hub Artist Theme Repo">template</a>!</h2>

I had started my own site when I discovered this awesome build-a-site web series. Funny/cool man Travis from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ" alt="DevTips Youtube Channel">DevTips</a> basically codes a great looking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI" alt="Build a site on DevTips">portfolio theme on youtube</a>. So what did I do? Stole his awesome work of course! 

If the purpose of doing this is to learn other ways at solving the same ol' problem then what better way than to see how someone else does it?

The difference:
  <ul>
  <li>My own code</li>
  <li>Mobile-first approach</li>
  <li>Use <a href="devtips.github.io/Artists-Theme/" alt="Artist Theme">live site</a> as mockup instead of PSD</li> 
  <li>Started with <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman" alt="Git Hub Yeoman Repo">Yeoman</a> but found problems with setting it up so starting with<a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate" alt="Git Hub HTML5 Boilerplate">html5 boilerplate</a>only instead</li>
  <li>My face and stuff</li>
  </ul>
